# API Boilerplate

This repository provides a boilerplate for creating a fully functional API using .NET technologies. It includes the setup for StyleCop, Entity Framework Core (EF Core), Swagger UI, AutoFixture, and Moq. The solution is structured with separate projects for Business Logic, Data Access, and API Endpoints to promote clean architecture and maintainability.
